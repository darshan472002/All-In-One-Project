In here im make it the two basic project using javascript. 
Its working and also im working on the some other projects those are made it on the javascript, html and css and much more.

The first project is based upon the World Clock Project using frontend like (HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT)

The second project is based upon the TODOs List project using (HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT). 
TODOs List is basically using for the if some tasks want to add in list, some tasks are adding, 
some tasks are delete, some tasks are clear the whole list. 
mainly using for maintain the daily routine in the list if also some tasks are not completed 
so basically remind the some tasks was pending like this TODOs List will be work.

That's all about the TODOS List and Wolrd Clock. Thank You!!
